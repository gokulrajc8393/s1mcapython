(C01) 7.Enter 2 lists of integers.Check 
        (a) Whether list are of same length 
        (b) whether list sums to same value 
        (c) whether any value occur in both

PROGRAM
l=input("enter list1 of integers seperated by spaces ")
l1=[int(num) for num in l.split()]
m=input("enter list2 of integers seperated by spaces ")
l2=[int(num) for num in m.split()]
print(l1)
print(l2)
a=len(l1)
b=len(l2)
if a==b:
  print("list are of same length")
else:
  print("list are not of same length")
c=sum(l1)
d=sum(l2)
if c==d:
  print("sum of list elements same")
else:
  print("sum of list elements not same")
l3=[x for x in l1 if x in l2]
print("value common in both list ",l3)

OUTPUT
enter list1 of integers seperated by spaces 4 5 6 7 8 9
enter list2 of integers seperated by spaces 4 5 6
[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
[4, 5, 6]
list are not of same length
sum of list elements not same
value common in both list  [4, 5, 6]

enter list1 of integers seperated by spaces 4 5 6 7 8
enter list2 of integers seperated by spaces 8 7 6 5 4
[4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
[8, 7, 6, 5, 4]
list are of same length
sum of list elements same
value common in both list  [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
